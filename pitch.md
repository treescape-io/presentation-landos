## [0:00-0:45] The Personal Journey: From Tech to Trees

"Four years ago, I left my career as a seasoned software architect to start a food forest in Paredes de Coura. Not for nostalgia, but necessity. Portugal has lost 80% of its rural population since the 1960s. Less than 20% of Portuguese now inhabit the interior. Over 2.3 million Portuguese—20% of the population—live abroad. The villages are aging, the young are leaving.

But emigration isn't even the real crisis. Portugal has more eucalyptus plantations proportionally than any country on Earth—covering a quarter of what we call 'forests.' These aren't forests—they're green deserts. In 2017 alone, these pyrogenic monocultures burned across 70% of fire-affected areas. With temperatures projected to rise 4°C by century's end, and the Iberian Peninsula experiencing climate change beyond IPCC's worst-case scenarios, we're engineering ecological collapse."

## [0:45-1:30] The Crisis and the Barrier

"By 2070, southern Iberia will see dramatic expansion of desert conditions. This isn't about uncomfortable summers—it's about the future viability of this peninsula we call home.

Portugal has anywhere from 100,000 hectares to over 1 million hectares of abandoned land—land that could be our salvation, but instead becomes fuel for catastrophic fires each year.

Agroforestry solves these interconnected crises. It creates meaningful rural employment that could reverse emigration. It sequesters carbon, prevents fires, restores water cycles, rebuilds soil.

So why isn't it everywhere?

**Complexity.** Forests are impossibly complex systems where everything affects everything else—soil, water, climate, thousands of species interactions—playing out across 60+ years. This complexity has made agroforestry impossible to scale. Until now."

## [1:30-2:30] The Solution: Making Complexity Manageable

"Meet Treescape—we're making agroforestry **simple, bankable, and exponentially scalable**.

We're building an AI-powered platform with three core pillars:

**1. Guided Agentic Intelligence**: Plant-level data represented from field to nation, guiding design through natural conversation.

**2. Algorithms and Open Data**: Climate, species, and multi-/hyper-spectral Earth Observation. Plant placement optimized through genetic algorithms.

**3. Integrated Business Models**: 60-year biophysical projections with bankable outcomes. Partnership with Wageningen University spinoff FarmTree.

I'm personally validating this on my 1.5 hectares in Silverto—transforming marginal woodland into intensive food forest."

## [2:30-2:50] Portugal's Opportunity

"Portugal is uniquely positioned to lead this regenerative revolution. With 34% rural population—among Europe's highest—this apparent weakness is actually our strength.

Abandoned land. Unresolved inheritance. Marginal agriculture.

But these lands were never spoiled by industrial farming—they remain ready for regeneration.

The choice is stark: regeneration or desertification. The technology exists. The knowledge exists. What's needed is the courage to embrace transformation at scale."

## [2:50-4:00] Scaling & Partnership Path

"Our scaling strategy follows a proven pattern: 10 hectares, then 100, then 1000. Each phase teaches us what the next one needs. Learn, scale, repeat.

We're starting with 3-5 pilot partners with 10+ hectare plots in diverse regions. These aren't free pilots—we're looking for founding customers who will co-develop solutions with us.

We're also seeking research collaborations in ecology, climate modeling, and applied ML to validate agroforestry in practice. And a CEO partner—I build solutions, but I need someone who can build the business alongside me.

**Our mission: Enable regeneration of 1 billion hectares globally.**
**Starting here in Portugal, where the need is urgent and the opportunity is immense.**

*Join us in turning Portugal's land crisis into its regenerative future.*"

## Q&A Preparation Points

### Technical Differentiation
- "We use genetic algorithms, not machine learning, for explainable optimization"
- "Our wizard-guided process creates fractal segmentation at every scale"
- "60-year modeling with species interactions, not just simple projections"

### Business Model
- "Co-development with founding customers, not free pilots"
- "Marketplace connecting landowners with certified designers"
- "Subscription model scaling from small farmers to government initiatives"

### Portuguese Context
- "As a Dutch resident, I'm deeply grateful to Portugal and committed to its future"
- "Silverto represents thousands of similar marginal lands across Portugal"
- "This creates rural employment—the key to reversing demographic decline"

### Scaling Strategy
- "3-5 pilots at 10ha → 100ha → 1000ha (10x rounds over 3-5 years)"
- "Each scale teaches us different optimization challenges"
- "My experience with ipfs-search proves I can handle web-scale systems"

### Climate Urgency
- "The Iberian Peninsula is beyond IPCC worst-case scenarios"
- "By 2070, desertification or regeneration—there's no middle ground"
- "Every year of delay means more catastrophic fires, more emigration"

## Delivery Notes

- **Tone**: Urgent but hopeful, technical but accessible
- **Energy**: Start strong with personal story, build to inspirational close
- **Respect**: Position as grateful resident contributing to Portugal's future
- **Leadership**: Frame as opportunity for Portugal to lead, not criticism
- **Visuals**: Have phone ready with screenshots of Silverto analysis if asked
