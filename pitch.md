## [0:00-0:45] The Personal Journey: From Tech to Trees

"Four years ago, I left my career as a seasoned software architect to start a food forest in Paredes de Coura. Not for nostalgia, but necessity. Portugal has lost 80% of its rural population since the 1960s. Less than 20% of Portuguese now inhabit the interior. Over 2.3 million Portuguese—20% of the population—live abroad. The villages are aging, the young are leaving.

But emigration isn't even the real crisis. Portugal has more eucalyptus plantations proportionally than any country on Earth—covering a quarter of what we call 'forests.' These aren't forests—they're green deserts. In 2017 alone, these pyrogenic monocultures burned across 70% of fire-affected areas. With temperatures projected to rise 4°C by century's end, and the Iberian Peninsula experiencing climate change beyond IPCC's worst-case scenarios, we're engineering ecological collapse."

## [0:45-2:00] The Paradox and the Problem

"By 2070, southern Iberia will see dramatic expansion of desert conditions. This isn't about uncomfortable summers—it's about the future viability of this peninsula we call home.

Portugal has anywhere from 100,000 hectares to over 1 million hectares of abandoned land—land that could be our salvation, but instead becomes fuel for catastrophic fires each year.

**Here's the paradox:** Agroforestry solves ALL these interconnected crises. It creates meaningful rural employment that could reverse emigration. It sequesters carbon, prevents fires, restores water cycles, rebuilds soil. It transforms degraded land into productive, resilient ecosystems.

So why isn't it everywhere? 

**Complexity.** Forests are impossibly complex systems where everything affects everything else—soil, water, climate, thousands of species interactions—playing out across 60+ years. This complexity has made agroforestry impossible to scale. Until now."

## [2:00-3:00] The Solution: Making Complexity Manageable

"Meet Treescape—we're making agroforestry **simple, bankable, and exponentially scalable**.

We're building an AI-powered platform with a unique approach:

1. **Wizard-guided process**: An intelligent agent that gathers information and performs smart, fractal segmentation—identifying terraces, fields, microclimates at every scale

2. **Genetic algorithms**: These efficiently and *explainably* solve agroforestry's massive problem space—optimizing placement of individual plants across thousands of hectares

3. **Interactive business models**: Users can adjust parameters and explore solutions—from multinational regions down to individual trees

4. **60-year projections**: We model economic and ecological outcomes across multiple generations, making agroforestry bankable for investors

This enables both top-down government initiatives and bottom-up farmer innovation—creating win-win dynamics across all stakeholders.

Through our partnership with FarmTree from Wageningen, we're integrating decades of biophysical forest modeling. I'm personally validating this on my 1.5 hectares in Silverto—transforming marginal woodland into intensive food forest."

## [3:00-4:00] Portugal's Competitive Advantage

"Portugal is uniquely positioned to lead this regenerative revolution. With about 34% rural population, we're among Europe's most rural countries. This apparent weakness is actually our strength:

- 30% of land is trapped in unresolved inheritance—we make it actionable
- 164 municipalities are at risk of desertification—we transform them into regenerative hubs
- 84% of grazing land is classified as 'poor'—we restore it profitably
- Large areas like my region in Silverto were never viable for industrial agriculture—they remain unspoiled, ready for regeneration

Portugal can become the laboratory for solutions the world desperately needs. If we want to show leadership in sustainable land use, if we want to give young Portuguese a reason to return, if we want to transform crisis into opportunity—this is how.

The choice is becoming stark: regeneration or desertification. The technology exists. The knowledge exists. What's needed is the courage to embrace transformation at scale."

## [4:00-5:00] The Partnership Invitation

"We're seeking three types of partners to catalyze this transformation:

1. **Pilot partners**: We need 3-5 landowners with 10+ hectare plots in diverse regions. These aren't free pilots—we're looking for founding customers who will co-develop solutions with us. After proving success at 10 hectares, we scale to 100, then 1000. I've done 10x scaling before—I built ipfs-search.com, a web-scale search engine for the decentralized web.

2. **Research collaborations**: Particularly soil scientists and climate modelers from institutions like Wageningen, ISA, or University of Évora to strengthen our models and validate outcomes.

3. **A CEO partner**: I'm a builder—I build solutions. But I need someone who shares this vision and can drive the business while I perfect the technology.

This isn't about venture capital or quick returns. It's about preventing ecological collapse while creating meaningful rural employment. It's about proving that complexity can be our competitive advantage.

**Our mission: Enable regeneration of 1 billion hectares globally.**
**Starting here in Portugal, where the need is urgent and the opportunity is immense.**

*Join us in turning Portugal's land crisis into its regenerative future.*"

## Q&A Preparation Points

### Technical Differentiation
- "We use genetic algorithms, not machine learning, for explainable optimization"
- "Our wizard-guided process creates fractal segmentation at every scale"
- "60-year modeling with species interactions, not just simple projections"

### Business Model
- "Co-development with founding customers, not free pilots"
- "Marketplace connecting landowners with certified designers"
- "Subscription model scaling from small farmers to government initiatives"

### Portuguese Context
- "As a Dutch resident, I'm deeply grateful to Portugal and committed to its future"
- "Silverto represents thousands of similar marginal lands across Portugal"
- "This creates rural employment—the key to reversing demographic decline"

### Scaling Strategy
- "3-5 pilots at 10ha → 100ha → 1000ha (10x rounds over 3-5 years)"
- "Each scale teaches us different optimization challenges"
- "My experience with ipfs-search proves I can handle web-scale systems"

### Climate Urgency
- "The Iberian Peninsula is beyond IPCC worst-case scenarios"
- "By 2070, desertification or regeneration—there's no middle ground"
- "Every year of delay means more catastrophic fires, more emigration"

## Delivery Notes

- **Tone**: Urgent but hopeful, technical but accessible
- **Energy**: Start strong with personal story, build to inspirational close
- **Respect**: Position as grateful resident contributing to Portugal's future
- **Leadership**: Frame as opportunity for Portugal to lead, not criticism
- **Visuals**: Have phone ready with screenshots of Silverto analysis if asked
